= Pyhthon Template documentation

This directory contains various documentation snippets to explain various parts
of python-template. It is not intended as comprehensive introduction and a lot
is left on the reader to get from the code but it should help with some common
tasks.

The good place to start is the link:./fork.adoc[forking documentation].
