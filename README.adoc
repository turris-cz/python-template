This is description of your project. Do NOT forget to modify it together with
title of this file, project dependencies and other parts of this file which
would require the change.

This file header contains version and date. It is required to enable icons that
are really nice. The policy is that version is always `V0.0` and date is the
project creation date, thus there is no need to update this with releases.
